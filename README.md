# Ionosphere_structure_detector
machine learning model leverages radar data from a sophisticated phased array system in Goose Bay, Labrador. By analyzing complex values derived from an autocorrelation function applied to received signals, the model accurately classifies ionosphere radar returns as "good" or "bad" based on structural characteristics.
